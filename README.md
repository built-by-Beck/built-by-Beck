💻 **Life Safety Technician by day. Developer, creator, and problem-solver by night.**  
From hospitals to hosting, fire extinguishers to full-stack apps—I build tools that solve real problems and I make them look good while doing it.

I believe that almost any challenge can be solved with the right application of technology. I approach every problem with determination, creativity, and precision. I don’t shy away from difficult tasks—in fact, I thrive on them. With the combination of my own skills and the power of AI, I am not just capable; I am a force to be reckoned with.

## 🚀 What I Do
- 🛡️ **YouCantSeeMeVPN** – building a privacy-first VPN service (WireGuard + Firebase + Stripe).  
- 🪙 **Rich Off Error Coins** – AI-powered numismatics: identify, verify, and profit from rare coin errors.  
- 🔥 **Fire Extinguisher Tracker** – mobile + web apps to simplify hospital safety compliance.  
- 🗺️ **Hospital Navigation App** – indoor turn-by-turn guidance for patients and staff.  
- 🎲 **Side Projects** – too many to list, but just know, I'm always available for hire (for the right price of course)
